# Google Landing Page Replica
# For educational purposes only!

The project assigned was to replicate Google's homepage as close as you could. The webpage designed here is based on what my current Google homepage looks like, as different users may have different landing pages, or the same but with a few variations.

Goals of this project was to utilize the foundational coding languages to structure a webpage (beginner-level) and add basic functionality to it.

So far, this site is able to do a basic search by text input in the search bar and can lead the user to another page with the results. Additionally, it is able to display an alert at the top, indicating what it is searching for (user input), but that is hidden in the JS file due to this site's ability to do an actual search. There are additional comments, primarily for myself, to explain what code does what as well as a reminder to myself of what previous code I used that worked and may want to revisit and test again for any future modifications. The GitHub shortcut works, as well as the art credit listed in the bottom left corner of the site.
